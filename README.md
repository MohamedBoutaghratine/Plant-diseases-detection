# Plant-diseases-detection
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automated tool for detecting plant diseases from leaf images. By leveraging the latest advancements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we have designed a model capable of precisely classifying the health status of various plants.

## Motivation
Monitoring and early diagnosis of plant diseases are crucial for preserving the productivity and quality of crops. However, this task can be tedious and may require the expertise of specialists. With the rise of deep learning, we have the opportunity to develop intelligent solutions to automate this process, benefiting both farmers and agricultural experts.

## Key Features
* Accurate identification of diseases from leaf images.
* Real-time classification of plant health status (healthy, diseased, etc.).
* User-friendly Gradio-based interface for simplified usage.
* Support for various plant species.

## Deep Learning Models
We have evaluated and compared the performance of several renowned CNN architectures for this classification task:

* VGG-19
* ResNet50
* EfficientNet B4

The results have shown that the EfficientNet B4 model offers the best performance, with exceptional training and validation accuracy.

## User Interface
To make our solution accessible to end-users, we have developed a user-friendly Gradio interface. This allows users to easily upload leaf images and instantly receive the model's diagnosis on the plant's health status.

## Contributions
We highly encourage contributions to this project. Feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or even pull requests if you would like to enhance or extend the existing functionalities.
